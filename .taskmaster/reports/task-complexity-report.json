		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Template File System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the file watcher integration to include error handling for file system events and logging for debugging purposes.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves integrating a file watcher with an existing server, which requires careful handling of file system events and real-time updates. The current subtasks cover the main requirements, but additional error handling and logging would improve robustness and maintainability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop JSON Schema Validator",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Integrate Ajv for schema validation, 2) Generate JSON schemas from TypeScript types, 3) Write unit and integration tests for validation logic.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating schema validation with TypeScript and generating schemas from types introduces moderate complexity, especially around type safety and integration with existing code. Three subtasks will help manage the integration, generation, and testing phases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Hono Server for Template Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Design endpoint structure, 2) Implement CRUD operations, 3) Integrate with existing routing, 4) Write integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "Adding new endpoints with CRUD operations and ensuring consistency with existing routing patterns is moderately complex. Four subtasks will help ensure thorough design, implementation, integration, and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Template Registry and In-Memory Storage",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Implement in-memory registry logic, 2) Write unit and integration tests for registry behavior.",
			"reasoning": "Leveraging existing in-memory storage patterns reduces complexity, but implementing a new registry and ensuring compatibility with the mock server still requires careful design and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance CLI Interface for Template Selection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Add template selection UI, 2) Implement template loading logic, 3) Test and validate CLI integration.",
			"reasoning": "Extending a CLI interface with new interactive features introduces moderate complexity, especially around user input handling and integration with existing components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Variable Input System for Templates",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Extend TextInput.tsx for variable collection, 2) Implement input validation, 3) Test with various template variable types.",
			"reasoning": "Building a modular and reusable input system for template variables is moderately complex, requiring careful integration with existing CLI patterns and thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Extend Message Sending Logic for Templates",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Modify endpoint for template support, 2) Implement variable substitution logic, 3) Test with both text and template messages.",
			"reasoning": "Extending an existing endpoint to support dynamic template objects and variable substitution is moderately complex, requiring careful integration and testing to ensure backward compatibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Webhook Simulation for Template Messages",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand to include: 1) Analyze current webhook simulation, 2) Design payloads, 3) Implement simulation logic, 4) Test end-to-end webhook delivery.",
			"reasoning": "Extending webhook simulation for new event types is moderately complex, requiring analysis, design, implementation, and thorough testing to ensure seamless integration with existing infrastructure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Test and Validate Template Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Review existing test patterns, 2) Design test cases for new features, 3) Implement functional tests, 4) Document test outcomes.",
			"reasoning": "Developing a comprehensive test suite for new and existing features is complex, requiring careful planning, implementation, and documentation to ensure robust validation and prevent regressions."
