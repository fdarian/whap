## Tools

### 1. Parse PRD `parse_prd`
*   **MCP Tool:** `parse_prd`
*   **CLI Command:** `task-master parse-prd [file] [options]`
*   **Description:** `Parse a Product Requirements Document, PRD, or text file with Taskmaster to automatically generate an initial set of tasks in tasks.json.`
*   **Key Parameters/Options:**
    *   `input`: `Path to your PRD or requirements text file that Taskmaster should parse for tasks.` (CLI: `[file]` positional or `-i, --input <file>`)
    *   `output`: `Specify where Taskmaster should save the generated 'tasks.json' file. Defaults to '.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json'.` (CLI: `-o, --output <file>`)
    *   `numTasks`: `Approximate number of top-level tasks Taskmaster should aim to generate from the document.` (CLI: `-n, --num-tasks <number>`)
    *   `force`: `Use this to allow Taskmaster to overwrite an existing 'tasks.json' without asking for confirmation.` (CLI: `-f, --force`)
*   **Usage:** Useful for bootstrapping a project from an existing requirements document.
*   **Notes:** Task Master will strictly adhere to any specific requirements mentioned in the PRD, such as libraries, database schemas, frameworks, tech stacks, etc., while filling in any gaps where the PRD isn't fully specified. Tasks are designed to provide the most direct implementation path while avoiding over-engineering.
*   **Important:** This MCP tool makes AI calls and can take up to a minute to complete. Please inform users to hang tight while the operation is in progress. If the user does not have a PRD, suggest discussing their idea and then use the example PRD in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt` as a template for creating the PRD based on their idea, for use with `parse-prd`.
